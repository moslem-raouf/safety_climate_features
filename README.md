# Feature selection using supervised classification algorithms

The 6-models trained with supervised classifiers alogirthms. These are: 
  1. Random Forest
  2. Bagging
  3. AdaBoost
  4. SVM
  5. Gaussian Naive Bayesian
  6. KNN 
Feature selection executed with three search strategies (FSS, BSS and GA) and in three rounds to select best 14, 11 and 6 features from original 22 features. 
The best results are generated by KNN and GNB. All results are presented in the "model_results.xlsx" file.
